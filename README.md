# Noom Cafe - Designed by [Alfonso Martinez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfonso-martinez-a6179a137/)

I was lucky enough to get the chance to work on this wonderful idea that Alfonso was able to come up with, complete with a dark mode! 
The website came out great, the design looks professional, and I'm glad I was able to implement the dark mode (hint: click the moon). I think it turned out great, and it is definitely one of my favorite projects!
