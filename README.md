My team had the wonderful oppurtunity to partner up with UX/UI designers. We each got our own designer and they gave us a design artifact. I was lucky enough to get the chance to work on this wonderful idea for a cafe that Alfonso was able to create in no time, complete with a dark mode! 
The website came out great, the design looks professional, and I'm glad I was able to implement the dark mode (hint: click the moon in the middle of the nav-bar). This is definitely one of my favorite projects, and Alfonso is a great designer.

## The Prototype

Alfonso gave me an awesome prototype to work with, I was very excited to get to work on it. He was a huge help, and any questions I had regarding to anything, such as colors or images, he was quick to respond.

## The Process
Implementing the dark mode was a stretch goal of mine, I had never created an app that could switch between light and dark mode before. Styled Components was a huge help, as I passed props to allow for switching color schemes.
